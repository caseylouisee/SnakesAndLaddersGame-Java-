# SnakesAndLaddersGame-Java-
Snakes and Ladders game made in Java. It was originally for a group coursework project. The final piece was however individual coursework and my submission is what is uploaded here. It achieved full marks in the submission. 

You can compile the code by:
Unzip the source code directory. Open the src directory in a terminal. Enter:
javac -cp lib/*: Board/*.java Display/*.java Menu/*.java Game/*.java Player/*.java Square/*.java
then:
java -cp lib/*: Menu.GameSelector 0
If you enter
java -cp lib/*: Menu.GameSelector 1
the unit tests will print out to the console/terminal. Otherwise the program will just run as normal.
